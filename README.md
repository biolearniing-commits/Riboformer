# RiboSTD: a Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Context-Dependent Translation Dynamics

Translation elongation is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis and changes in the translational landscape are associated with age-related decline in protein homeostasis. We developed RiboSTD, a deep learning-based framework for predicting context-dependent changes in translation dynamics using a transformer architecture. RiboSTD accurately predicts ribosome densities at the codon level, corrects experimental artifacts, and identifies sequence determinants underlying ribosome collision. Our tool offers a comprehensive and interpretable approach for standardizing ribosome profiling datasets and facilitating biological discoveries.
